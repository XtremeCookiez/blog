I'm a software developer who also loves fitness, cars, and cooking. I'm not really sure what will
end up here, but I currently plan on posting my ramblings and useful tips I come across here. For
now, I'll probably stick to software/sysadmin stuff but don't be shocked if a post about my current
car troubles or workout routine pops up.
